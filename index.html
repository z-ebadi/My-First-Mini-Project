					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</div>
					<p>
					Hello, I am Zakiye, a 25 year old Malaysian-based refugee with more than 2 years of experience in doing surveys and interview on the phone.I've been living in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia since 2015. I'm a fan of music, sports and technology.</p>
					<p>
					Every day I think about everything that happens around us owes the codes that behind the scenes such as traffic lights that change color at a specific time. I'd love to learn more about coding world and be one of the students in <a href="https://recodemalaysia.com/" target="_blank">RECODE </a>. I really appreciate <a href="https://recodemalaysia.com/" target="_blank">RECODE</a> to give me this opportunity. My dream to become a professional programmer is still alive and I'm just trying my best to make it true.

					<h2>Education</h2>
				</div>
					<p>
					A few years after I graduated from high school in Iran (the country that I was born) I came here. I attended 4 months English course and IT course in <a href="https://helpcat.edu.my/" target="_blank">HELP College of Arts and Technology </a>in Malaysia and 2 days in Bootcamps. After attending these classes I become more enthusiastic about programming.
					</p>
				<div id="Hobbies">
					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
				</div>
					<p>
					I love woodworking, traveling, swimming, cycling and hiking. We have also a group for hiking that we go every month. My favorite intellectual game is chess, but I've never played it professionally.

				<h2>Why I love programming:</h2>
					<ol>
					<h3><li>I'll always be challenged</li></h3>
					<br>
						<p>
						Since there is never a shortage of things to learn, there is also no shortage of challenges. For each problem there are countless ways to solve it and each way has its own challenge	
						</p>
					<h3><li>I can work remotely</li></h3>
					<br>
						<p>
						As a freelance programmer, you can work wherever you want: at home in your pyjamas, in a hotel room while traveling around the world, or even in your favorite caf√©.
						</p>
					<h3><li>It's a creative outlet</li></h3>
					<br>
						<p>
						Programming is a highly creative profession. Every time you write a new program you create and learn something new.
						</p>
					<h3><li>Programming is like a gym for my brain</li></h3>
					<br>
						<p>
						Coding is similar to lifting weights for the brain. When developers work on challenging projects, they can push their brains to the limit on new and stimulating problems. It makes developers very flexible thinkers.
